The Satanic Open Source Liturgy Project
(satanicopensource for short) is not affiliated
with the Satanic Temple, the Church of Satan,
or any other Satanic organization that
you have likely heard of.
This site makes no mention as to whether or not
there are any shared members with any of these
groups - but even if there are, this project is still not
affiliated with any of those organizations.
